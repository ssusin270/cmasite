The Center for Mortgage Access (CMA) announces a new policy research 
organization 
dedicated to the role of 
public mortgage finance in expanding equitable access to homeownership.

Despite playing a central role in the U.S. housing market, government-backed 
mortgage institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac receive relatively 
little public attention. These entities—along with the Federal 
Housing Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Rural 
Housing Service—support roughly three-quarters of all U.S. home loans. Their 
guarantees have helped millions of Americans access homeownership, reduce 
borrowing costs, and shift financial risk from households to institutions 
better positioned to bear it.

At a time of mounting concern about housing affordability and rising mortgage 
costs, CMA is the first organization focused exclusively on preserving and 
strengthening the federal government’s role in mortgage finance.

“There’s a well-established ecosystem of organization engaged in housing 
advocacy 
and policy work,”  said founder Scott Susin, “but there’s a gap when it comes 
to protecting and 
strengthening the institutions that make mortgage credit broadly accessible. 
CMA aims to fill that gap with research, analysis, and advocacy that helps 
keep these systems working for the public.”

Scott Susin brings deep experience in housing finance and fair lending. Prior 
to founding CMA, he served as an economist at the Federal Housing Finance 
Agency, the primary regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, where he focused 
on
consumer protection and affordable housing. Earlier in his career, he led 
econometric analysis at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
for two of the agency’s largest fair lending settlements, including the 
then-largest redlining case in U.S. history.

Susin’s research has been published in leading academic journals and cited in 
national media, handbooks, and textbooks. His work spans the economics of 
mortgage finance, subsidized housing, discrimination, and local housing 
markets.
His studies have explored appraisal bias, statistical methods for calculating 
damages 
and the impacts of subsidized housing on local house prices and employment.

CMA will publish original research and policy analysis, engage with 
stakeholders across the housing finance system, and advocate for a more 
inclusive and resilient mortgage market.
